# My Grandfather Website

This is a repository for a website for my granfather, Yechezkel Alhindi.
In this website you can see his history, pictures of my grandpa and their description (you can also click on the picture to see the full picture). Yoa can also listen to a playlist of one of his loved singers, like this website on facebook, scan a QR code to get into my website, and contact with me via email!
I tried to put as many css features as I can, for my personal taste.

Hope you like my website!
